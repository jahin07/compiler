# Compiler Design

This is a compiler in Java using the ASM byte code framework for code generation in Java Byte Code.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software

```
Eclipse Neon
asm-5.1.jar
asm-util-5.1.jar
JUnit 4
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Clone the repository and add all the java files to Eclipse keeping the directory structure same


Install the dependencies

Compile the program

## Running the tests

Make a JUnit Test file with custom made test cases and test the code using those

## Deployment

Export the project as a JAR file

## Built With

* [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) - The IDE
* [ASM](http://asm.ow2.org/) - Bytecode generation
* [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/) - Used to develop test cases
